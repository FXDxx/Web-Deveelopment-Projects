<p>Sir Muhammad Iqbal (9 November 1877, 21 April 1938) was a South Asian Islamic philosopher, 
poet and politician. His poetry is considered to be among the greatest of the 
20th century, and his vision of a cultural and political ideal for the Muslims
of British-ruled India is widely regarded as having animated the impulse for the 
Pakistan Movement. He is commonly referred to by the honourific Allama.

Born and raised in Sialkot, Punjab, Iqbal completed his BA and MA at the Government College
in Lahore. He taught Arabic at the Oriental College in Lahore from 1899 until 1903, 
during which time he wrote prolifically. Notable among his Urdu poems from this period 
are "Parinde ki Faryad" (translated as "A Bird's Prayer"), an early contemplation on animal 
rights, and "Tarana-e-Hindi" (translated as "Anthem of India"), a patriotic poem—both composed
for children. In 1905, he departed from India to pursue further education in Europe, first 
in England and later in Germany. In England, he earned a second BA at Trinity College, 
Cambridge, and subsequently qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. In Germany, he obtained
a PhD in philosophy at the University of Munich, with his thesis focusing on "The Development
of Metaphysics in Persia" in 1908. Upon his return to Lahore in 1908, Iqbal established a law
practice but primarily focused on producing scholarly works on politics, economics, history, 
philosophy, and religion. He is most renowned for his poetic compositions, including 
"Asrar-e-Khudi," for which he was honored with a British knighthood upon its publication,
"Rumuz-e-Bekhudi," and "Bang-e-Dara." His literary works in the Persian language garnered him 
recognition in Iran, where he is commonly known as Eghbal-e Lahouri (Persian: اقبال لهوری), 
meaning "Iqbal of Lahore."</p>
